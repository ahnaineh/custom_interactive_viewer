## 0.0.4 - 2025-04-15

### Added
- When the viewer is tapped, it's in focus, allowing to directly use the keyboard to control it (arrows, page up/down, home/end). Previous focusing was done by navigating to the widget with the tab or arrow keys.
  Note: You can use the focus node to know when it's in focus & when not and request focus programmatically, check the [org_chart](https://pub.dev/packages/org_chart) example for more details.
- Added invertArrowKeyDirection property to the controller, which allows you to invert the arrow key direction.
